    "description": "Though Central Asia is off the beaten track today, this wasn’t always the case. In fact, the Silk Road passed through many of the region’s main cities (including Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv, Khujand and Osh). As merchants stopped in these cities on their way from China to Europe, they traded not only goods, but also knowledge, with locals. This made Central Asia a lively region with master-craftsmen, world-class scholars, and a diverse population. Between the cities, the Silk Road passed through remote and evocative landscapes – including the Tajikistan’s towering Pamir Mountains, Turkmenistan’s and Uzbekistan’s vast deserts, and Kyrgyzstan’s secluded alpine lakes.",
